 //Explanation-  Async Callback function goes into WebAPI envi. then pushed into Callback Queue(CbQ) and Event Loops constantly monniter the the Call Stack and CbQ, but Global Execution Context needs more than > 10 seconds to completed so setTimeout wait for callstack to get emptied. So SetTimeout wait in CbQ until GEC gets finished.
